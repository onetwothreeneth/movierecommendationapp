Recommendation should be based on the movie casts, genre and movie tag
Every time a user adds a movie to watch list, or rated and reviewed a movie positively; the movie's genre, tags and movie casts attributes should be added to "user's interest," which will be the basis of the recommendation (e.g if I added Maleficent to watchlist, Maleficent's genre, casts and tags attribute will be added to my "user's interest." If I give Blank Panther a positive rating and review (Sentiment Analysis will be used to figure out if the review is positive), Black Panther’s genre, casts and tags attribute will be added to my "user's interest." )
The app should recommend the top 3 movies similar to the "user's interest" (similarity is based on the cosine similarity score).
